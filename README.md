# Projects after Springboard

To enter the world of data science as a career changer coming from the private education sector, I was told over and over again to show off my portfolio. But, where does one start? Also, I realised without continuous practice I was starting to forget even the basics. 

So, here I am going to work through the plethora of resources Springboard's Data Science course threw at me. My goal is to use this repository to practice the basics of python programming, solidy my understanding of the mathematical theory that is useful for machine learning algorithms, and apply machine learning and deep learning to projects.
